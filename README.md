### Structure

I followed the steps on [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658) to setup Babel, Webpack, and React from scratch.

For the Redux portion, I was significantly helped by the [LinkedIn Learning course, "Learning Redux," by Alex Banks](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-redux/plan-a-redux-app).
